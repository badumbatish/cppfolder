This is the setup that I use when I'm starting a new project or just a small tinkering to do in C++

Setting the same things up and typing them all over again can be quite terrifying.

I figure by having this template of a project like this, my workflow will be better and I don't have to bother setting up things again. I just have to follow the instructions in the folder

I included the normal coding stuff and a google test folder in here.

A readme template is also present.

MIT licensed, anybody can use it.
