Be sure to have google test at the ready to use this.

If you use codeblocks, codelites, or vs studio, be sure to add -lgtest -pthread to your linker options, and add googletest to the libraries search path.

Name of the libary will be according to your IDE's regulations
- For example, if it doesn't require file extensions, just type in gtest instead of gtest.h

This is my setting for linker:

	Use with global settings:	append
	Linker options:		-lgtest -pthread
	Libraries Search Path:		/usr/src/googletest/googletest
	Libraries: 			gtest
